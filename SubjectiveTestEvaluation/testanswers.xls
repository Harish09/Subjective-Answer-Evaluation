	1.Shared Memory-All the processors share a common memory
	2.Shared Disk -All the processors share a common disk
	3.Shared Nothing-The processors share neither a common memory nor common disk.
	4.Hierarchical Architecture-This model is a hybrid of the preceding three architectures.

	1.Shared Memory-
		
	In a shared-memory architecture, the processors and disks have access to a common
	memory, typically via a bus or through an interconnection network. The
	benefit of shared memory is extremely efficient communication between processors—
	data in shared memory can be accessed by any processor without being
	moved with software. A processor can send messages to other processors much
	faster by using memory writes (which usually take less than a microsecond) than
	by sending a message through a communication mechanism. The downside of
	shared-memory machines is that the architecture is not scalable beyond 32 or 64
	processors because the bus or the interconnection network becomes a bottleneck
	(since it is shared by all processors). Adding more processors does not help after
	a point, since the processors will spend most of their time waiting for their turn
	on the bus to access memory.
	Shared-memory architectures usually have large memory caches at each processor,
	so that referencing of the shared memory is avoided whenever possible.
	2.Shared Disk
		In the shared-disk model, all processors can access all disks directly via an interconnection
	network, but the processors have private memories. There are two
	advantages of this architecture over a shared-memory architecture. First, since
	each processor has its own memory, the memory bus is not a bottleneck. Second,
	it offers a cheap way to provide a degree of fault tolerance: If a processor (or its
	memory) fails, the other processors can take over its tasks, since the database is
	resident on disks that are accessible from all processors. We can make the disk
	subsystem itself fault tolerant by using a RAID architecture, as described in Chapter
	10. The shared-disk architecture has found acceptance in many applications.
	The main problem with a shared-disk system is again scalability. Although
	the memory bus is no longer a bottleneck, the interconnection to the disk subsystem
	is now a bottleneck; it is particularly so in a situation where the database
	makes a large number of accesses to disks. Compared to shared-memory systems,
	shared-disk systems can scale to a somewhat larger number of processors, but
	communication across processors is slower (up to a few milliseconds in the absence
	of special-purpose hardware for communication), since it has to go through
	a communication network.</Data></Cell>

	Parallel systems improve processing and I/O speeds by using multiple processors and disks in parallel. Parallel machines are becoming increasingly common, making the study of parallel database systems correspondingly more important. There are several architectural models for parallel machines.
• Shared memory. All the processors share a common memory
• Shared disk. All the processors share a common set of disks
Shared-disk systems are sometimes called clusters.
• Shared nothing. The processors share neither a common memory nor common
disk
• Hierarchical. This model is a hybrid of the preceding three architectures


--&gt; SharedMemory
	In a shared-memory architecture, the processors and disks have access to a common memory, typically via a bus or through an interconnection network. The benefit of shared memory is extremely efficient communication between processors
data in shared memory can be accessed by any processor without being moved with software. A processor can send messages to other processors much faster by using memory writes (which usually take less than a microsecond) than by sending a message through a communication mechanism. The downside of shared-memory machines is that the architecture is not scalable beyond 32 or 64
processors because the bus or the interconnection network becomes a bottleneck .
	Adding more processors does not help after a point, since the processors will spend most of their time waiting for their turn on the bus to access memory. Shared-memory architectures usually have large memory caches at each processor, so that referencing of the shared memory is avoided whenever possible However, at least some of the data will not be in the cache, and accesses will have to go to the shared memory. Moreover, the caches need to be kept coherent; that is, if a processor performs a write to a memory location, the data in that memory location should be either updated at or removed from any processor where the data are cached. Maintaining cache coherency becomes an increasing overhead with increasing numbers of processors. Consequently, shared-memory machines are not capable of scaling up beyond a point; current shared-memory machines cannot support more than 64 processors.

--&gt;Shared Disk
	In the shared-disk model, all processors can access all disks directly via an interconnection network, but the processors have private memories. There are two advantages of this architecture over a shared-memory architecture. First, since each processor has its own memory, the memory bus is not a bottleneck.

1)Shared Memory model:

	In a shared-memory architecture, the processors and disks have access to a common
memory, typically via a bus or through an interconnection network. The
benefit of shared memory is extremely efficient communication between processors
data in shared memory can be accessed by any processor without being
moved with software. A processor can send messages to other processors much
faster by using memory writes than by sending a message through a communication mechanism. The downside of
shared-memory machines is that the architecture is not scalable beyond 32 or 64
processors because the bus or the interconnection network becomes a bottleneck
.Adding more processors does not help after a point, since the processors will spend most of their time waiting for their turn
on the bus to access memory.Shared-memory architectures usually have large memory caches at each processor,
so that referencing of the shared memory is avoided whenever possible.

2)Shared Disk model:
	
	In the shared-disk model, all processors can access all disks directly via an interconnection

advantages of this architecture over a shared-memory architecture. First, since

Shared Memory:
In this architecture, the processors and disks have access to a common memory, typically via a bus . The benefit of shared memory is extremely efficient communication between processors—
data in shared memory can be accessed by any processor without being moved with software. A processor can send messages to other processors much
faster by using memory writes (which usually take less than a microsecond) than by sending a message through a communication mechanism. The disadvantage of
shared-memory machines is that the architecture is not scalable beyond 32 or 64 processors because the bus or the interconnection network becomes a bottleneck
(since it is shared by all processors). Adding more processors does not help after a point, since the processors will spend most of their time waiting for their turn
on the bus to access memory.
Shared-memory architectures usually have large memory caches at each processor,
so that referencing of the shared memory is avoided whenever possible. Consequently, shared-memory machines
are not capable of scaling up beyond a point; current shared-memory machines
cannot support more than 64 processors.

Shared Disk
In the shared-disk model, all processors can access all disks directly via an interconnection
network, but the processors have private memories. 
Advantage:
since each processor has its own memory, the memory bus is not a bottleneck. Second,
it offers a cheap way to provide a degree of fault tolerance: If a processor (or its
memory) fails, the other processors can take over its tasks, since the database is
resident on disks that are accessible from all processors. We can make the disk
subsystem itself fault tolerant by using a RAID architecture, as described in Chapter
10. The shared-disk architecture has found acceptance in many applications.
The main problem with a shared-disk system is again scalability. Although
the memory bus is no longer a bottleneck, the interconnection to the disk subsystem
is now a bottleneck; it is particularly so in a situation where the database
makes a large number of accesses to disks. Compared to shared-memory systems,
shared-disk systems can scale to a somewhat larger number of processors, but
communication across processors is slower (up to a few milliseconds in the absence
of special-purpose hardware for communication), since it has to go through
a communication network.</Data></Cell>

Downside – architecture is not scalable beyond 32 or 64 processors since the bus or the interconnection network becomes a bottleneck
